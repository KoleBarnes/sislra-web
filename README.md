South Island Straight Liners Racing Association

_Drag Racers Against Street Racing_

SISLRA is focused on saving lives and is concentrating efforts to attract 'street racers' to our sanctioned drag race venue. Students, non students and racers of all ages are encouraged to come to the drags. No previous experience is needed. There are club members and track officials to explain the finer details of this exciting type of motor sport.

South Island Straight Liners Racing Association was formed back in the summer of 1980. A small handful of car and hot rod enthusiasts had a desire to test their cars, and held their meeting in a small area above a local body shop.
